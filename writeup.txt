Part 1

2. While the analytical jacobian is obviously more accurate, some simple analysis shows that the central differences jacobian contained small error when the value for alpha was small enough. 

Using alpha = 0.0000001, the largest difference I was able to find was at theta = [pi,pi]', at which the difference in the jacobian was equal to
[0.0000, 0.0000; 0.4441 E-08, 0.6077 E-08].

Thus, the central differences jacobian will definitely be accurate enough for our needs, although the analytical jacobian is preferred when possible.

The finite differences jacobian may be used when the analytical jacobian is complicated or difficult to compute (as in part 2 of this assignment).  It may also be used if the functions in the analytical jacobian are unstable and prone to error.


4. The tests comparing Newton to Broyden were done with the following data:
l = [1,1]'
theta0 = [pi/2,pi/2]'
pos = [0,0]'
n = 10

Time:
Broyden took about 0.1 milliseconds longer than Newton.

Residual:
The two methods obtained a similar residual (difference of 2E-16). Again, Newton method came out slightly ahead. 

I tried a couple of different number as well, and most of the time Newton was more time efficient, and more accurate.  However, the differences were very minor.
